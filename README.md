# Game of Life

This is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, where the rules and mechanics are based on the original game. The player can control and observe as cells "live" and "die" on the grid, according to the specified rules. This is a modified version where cells can penetrate through the walls and reappear on the other side, with a 100x100 grid size.

## How to play:
- Use the arrow keys to select the cell you want to change.
- Press the spacebar to toggle the cell's state between "alive" and "dead."
- Press the enter key to start the evolution of the cells.

The game is simple, yet has remarkable depth and the potential for creating interesting patterns. We encourage you to try it out and discover the mysteries of this classic game.
